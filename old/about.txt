The original incarnation of Magpie was a strictly static procedural language,
with the compiler and interpreter written in C#. The new Magpie bears some
semblance to this (at least to me, they feel similar), but is largely
incompatible.

This directory contains the old C# stuff that hasn't been repurposed to work
with the new Magpie (and likely never will). It's here as a reference,
historical footnote, and mainly because I can't bear to trash so much code.
