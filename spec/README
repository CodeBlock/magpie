This directory contains Magpie's executable formal specification. The spec is a
Magpie program that should be easily human readable, but also machine
verifiable. If a Magpie interpreter can run the spec without errors, it is a
conforming implementation.

At least, that's the plan. The spec still needs a lot of filling in, but it's
getting there.

--- Executing the Spec ---------------------------------------------------------

You can run the spec to see how the interpreter measures up by running init.mag.
It will write the results to stdout.
