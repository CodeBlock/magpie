The website for Magpie is generated from a tree of markdown files by a little Python script. It uses Pygments with a custom lexer for Magpie. To get the lexer visible to markdown, it needs to be installed. The easiest way is to do:

  <from repo root dir>
  $ cd docs/site/magpie
  $ python setup.py develop

Then the site can be generated by doing:

  $ cd ..
  $ python generate-docs.py
  
That will create an "html" directory in the current directory with the entire site.

This stuff is still under development! To do:
* Create a correct breadcrumb trail on the top of each page.
* Set the page title correctly.
* Add lots more docs.
