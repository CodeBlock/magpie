^title Expressions

Expressions are the building blocks for programs. In fact, programs *are*
expressions. Unlike most imperative languages, but like most functional
languages, Magpie does not have *statements*, only expressions. Flow control,
blocks, and variable declarations are all expressions which return values. This
is valid in Magpie:

    :::magpie
    print(if result then "yes" else "no")
