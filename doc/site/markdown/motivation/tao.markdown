^title The Tao of Magpie

### 1

The programmer has a goal in her mind. She translates this goal into the language of code. Then she writes comments describing her original goal.

Why must she explain herself twice? Because the language of code is not the language of their intent.

When a language is good, the programmer does not need comments: the code will be indistinguishable from them.

### 2

When the programmer sits down to program, she must clear her mind and focus on the problem. If a language has many features and edge cases, her mind is cluttered. She has no room for her work.

When a language has few features it stays out of her way and lets her work.

Still, it is nice if she doesn't have to build her own chair before she can sit down.

### 3

A Lisper looks at C code and cannot remember which has higher precedence,
logical operators or comparisons, bitwise or arithmetic.

The C programmer looks at Lisp and cannot follow the parentheses.

Many levels of precedence is hard to remember. Few is hard to read. What is the right number?

Five. More or less.

A mathematician looks at a language and recoils in anger. "This language has no formal definition! No proof of correctness!"

The Sage looks up from his dessert. "I cannot prove that this ice cream is correct. But it is delicious, and I am certain it is better than eating dirt."

If people enjoy something, their heart proves its rightness.

It doesn't hurt to have some theory to back it up, though.
