^title Numbers

Magpie doesn't have floating point numbers yet. (I know, I know. I'm working on it!) Integers look like you expect:

    :::magpie
    0
    1234
    -5678

Their class is `Int`.

<p class="future">
The long-term goal here is to have a pretty complete numeric tower &agrave; la Scheme or Python.
