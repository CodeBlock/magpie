Magpie's syntax is a good bit simpler than many other languages. Its main inspirations are [Io](http://www.iolanguage.com/) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Magpie tries to reduce the amount of required punctuation that encrusts code in other languages while at the same time being more flexible with what you are allowed to do.

The sections here explain the details of Magpie's syntax:

1. [Compound Literals](syntax/compound-literals.html)
1. [Functions](syntax/functions.html)
1. [Messages](syntax/messages.html)
1. [Variables](syntax/variables.html)
1. [Flow Control](syntax/flow-control.html)
1. [Precedence](syntax/precedence.html)
