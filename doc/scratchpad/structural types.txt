To clean up tuples and records:

- Come up with new naming scheme for tuple fields so that a "_" prefix can be
  used for private members.
- Change code and base lib to use new field names.
- Create distinct classes for each tuple arity with getters for the fields.
- Create distinct class on demand for a record with getters for each field.
- Get rid of direct field lookup in Interpreter#lookupMember. All fields should
  be accessed through getters.
- Make sure Record#type also creates a record with an appropriate class and
  doesn't just set raw fields.
- Figure out if the type objects for tuples and records should themselves be
  tuples and records or just interfaces. Since they'll have unique classes
  anyway, it may be simpler to just make them interfaces.
- Implement Tuple#type. It currently has no implementation at all.
