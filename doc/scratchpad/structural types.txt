To clean up tuples and records:

+ Come up with new naming scheme for tuple fields so that a "_" prefix can be
  used for private members.
+ Change code and base lib to use new field names.
+ Create getters for the fields on the Tuple class.
+ Implement Tuple#type. It currently has no implementation at all.
- Get rid of direct field lookup in Interpreter#lookupMember. All fields should
  be accessed through getters.
- Make sure Record#type also creates a record with an appropriate class and
  doesn't just set raw fields.
