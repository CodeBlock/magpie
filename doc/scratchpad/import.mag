Prefix

Can both rename and export same name

Also, exclude, or only include certain names. Three cases:
1. Include everything, but maybe rename some specific stuff.
2. Only include the specified names.
3. Include everything but the excluded names.

(module <module name> <module declaration> ...)

<module declaration>:
- (export <exportspec> ...)
- (import <importset> ...)
- (begin <command or definition> ... )
- (include <filename1> <filename2> ...)
- (include-ci <filename1> <filename2> ...)
- (cond-expand <cond-expandclause> ...)

<export spec>:
- <identifier>
- (rename <identifier1> <identifier2>)

<import set>:
- <module name>
- (only <import set> <identifier> ...)
- (except <import set> <identifier> ...)
- (prefix <import set> <identifier>)
- (rename <import set> (<identifier1> <identifier2>) ...)

In the first form, all of the identifiers in the named moduleâ€™s export clauses are imported with the same names (or the exported names if exported with a rename form). The additional <import set> forms modify this set as follows:
- An only form produces a subset of the given <import set>, including only the listed identifiers (af- ter any renaming). It is an error if any of the listed identifiers are not found in the original set.
- An except form produces a subset of the given <import set>, excluding the listed identifiers (after any renaming). It is an error if any of the listed identifiers are not found in the original set.
- A rename form modifies the given <import set>, replac- ing  each  instance  of  <identif ier1 > with  <identif ier2 >. It is an error if any of the listed <identifier1>s are not found in the original set.
- A prefix form automatically renames all identifiers in the given <import set>, prefixing each with the speci- fied <identifier>.
import declarations may also be made at the top-level of a program. In a module declaration, the same identifier may not be imported more than once.
