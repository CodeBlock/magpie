Syntax:
- Being able to omit parens with single-arg methods is nice, but it feels weird
  with thing like "print" where the arg may be an expression with lower
  precedence so you have to parentheses for that:
  
  print "hi"
  print ("a" + "b") // parens here are annoying
  
  It would be nice if it felt consistent.

- Some kind of message cascade syntax. Users shouldn't have to explicitly create
  fluid interfaces.

  builder.append "one" ..append "two" ..append "three"

- Consider following more IO-style syntax:

  foo bar                // no-arg method
  foo bar(1)             // one-arg method 
  foo bar bang(2, 3) baz // chain

  So dots aren't needed for methods, but parens always are for args.
