Magpie is a simple embeddable strongly-typed
memory-managed procedural language.

Like its namesake, it collects the shiniest parts
of several different languages:

  - The syntax looks a lot like Ruby.

  - But is as simple as Smalltalk.

  - Its simple and procedural like C.

  - But garbage collects memory like Java.

  - Its type system is like ML's.

  - But its generics are like C++ templates.

  - Its small and embeddable like Lua.

The result, I hope, is a cohesive little language
suitable for embedding but with better error-
checking and performance than the dynamic
languages most typically used for embedding today.

It is also a bit of an experiment to see if the
procedural paradigm is still relevant if you bring
in modern advancements in memory management and a
cleaner syntax.


--- Hello, world! --------------------------------

Here's a tiny sample of Magpie:

  Main (->) Print "Hello, world!"
  
Like C, all code must reside in functions, and
execution starts by calling Main. The (->) is the
signature for the function. In this case, Main
takes no arguments and returns nothing. Here's a
slightly more interesting example:

  Main (->) Hello World
  
  Hello (who String ->)
    def text <- "Hello, " + who
    Print text
  end
  
  World (-> String) "world!"
  
This program still prints "Hello, world!", but
shows a few more language features. It defines
three functions: Main, Hello, and World.

Main calls World, passing it no parameters. It
then passes the result of that to Hello. In C,
this would look like Hello(World()).

Hello takes a single string argument and places it
in the variable "who". The body of Hello is a
block: an expression containing a list of other
expressions. The first expression in the block
defines a local variable "text", and assigns it
the result of concatenating "Hello, " and who.

In Magpie, variables are not declared with types.
Instead, the type is inferred from the expression
used to initialize it. Variables are always
initialized when declared. This gets rid of
uninitialized variable errors.

Assignment is done using "<-" instead of "=" like
in other languages. This is to clarify that
assignment isn't really related to equality at
all.

World takes no arguments but returns a string, in
this case the literal "world!". Functions do not
need an explicit "return" in Magpie: the result of
evaluating the function body is implicitly
returned like in Ruby.


--- Where's it at --------------------------------

Magpie still has a good way to go before it's
ready for real use. The ultimate goal is to have
a portable ANSI C interpreter and a self-hosting
compiler.

Right now, there is a prototype C# compiler and
interpreter. My plan is to get most of the
language features working cleanly in the C#
compiler, and then port that over to Magpie. The
C interpreter should be comparatively easy (with
static languages, most of the work is in the
compiler).

In the meantime, a lot of the language is still in
flux, and several important features (pattern
matching, lazy evaluation, closures) have yet to
be implemented. But many other things are there
and working: unions, structs, generics. There's
plenty to play around with.
